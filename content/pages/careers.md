    text: >
      At CSULB, our Statistical Consulting Group is made up of highly skilled
      graduate students who provide specialized expertise in data science,
      statistics, and visualization to local businesses. We offer support for
      business projects in two primary categories: Exploratory Projects, which
      assist businesses in assessing the feasibility of ideas and developing
      project plans over a quarterâ€”ideal for grant proposals and preliminary
      planning; and Research Product Projects, aimed at delivering specific
      outcomes such as analyses, data models, or visualizations, with durations
      ranging from 2-12 months and clearly defined goals. Our team, including
      top-tier student consultants, is prepared to turn your data into
      actionable insights that propel your business forward. Check out our
