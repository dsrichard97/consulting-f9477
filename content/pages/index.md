          This market research project analyzed survey data on grocery shopping
          demographics, shopping habits, engagement, needs, and solutions for
          populations of interest. The analysis identified distinct demographic
          profiles for the general population (by age groups) and the key
          segments, including varying levels of engagement and shopping habits.
          Strategic recommendations focused on tailoring marketing efforts and
          synthesizing insights from shopper habits and engagement to address
          unique needs and preferences of the different age groups and segments.

          The project was a study using US Census data on a topic of our choice.
          My group decided to investigate fertility rates across the US (the
          number of births per 1,000 women in a given population). We compared
          the fertility rates across demographics such as ethnicity, age and
          education level, and saw how these rates shifted over time. We also
          included a visual comparing the fertility rates across the US states,
          with one map showing rates in 2010, and the other in 2021.
