**CONSULTING RATES**

The Center provides three payment options for our services: hourly rates, grant preparation support, and a subscription model. Please note that certain payment options may only be available to clients with specific affiliations.

We offer a complimentary initial consultation for all new clients. This one-hour meeting is designed to assess the statistical requirements of your project in terms of time, type,  and scope. Following this discussion, the client and our statistician will outline a detailed statistical plan and scope of work.

Subsequent to the initial meeting and upon agreement on the Scope of Work, we will prepare a Sales and Service Agreement for signature by both parties (Client & CSC). An advance payment of 25% of the total fee is required to commence work or support. The balance (75%) will be billed according to agreement schedule. For projects estimated to require less than 10 hours, we will request full payment upfront after project initiation(2 weeks from start date in agreement).

**Consulting Expert for Strategy and Transformation**

**Grant Preparation Support Model at CSULB:**
Our objective is to foster a cooperative atmosphere conducive to successful grant submissions by offering grant preparation support at no cost. We encourage principal investigators, for grant proposals aided by CSULB staff in their preparation and composition, to include our statistical analysts as part of the team, contributing a fair share of effort as deemed appropriate.

**Subscription Model:**
Departments or researchers in need of statistical support can opt into a subscription, effectively securing a dedicated portion of our CSULB staff's time. This model requires a commitment to support a portion of the staff's effort for a minimum duration of six months, with the smallest allowable effort set at 20%.

**Billable Rates:**
Our billable hours encompass all project-related work that is charged to a client as per the agreed rate. The tasks performed by statistical consultants at CSULB are comprehensive, including but not limited to: conducting preliminary reviews, engaging in requisite research to grasp the scientific or technological foundations, selecting the most suitable methodology, executing the analysis programming, examining the results, and communicating findings to the client. Our consultants' role transcends simple data entry, offering a depth of expertise that ensures the highest quality of statistical collaboration. For further insight into the significant role played by statistical consultants, we recommend exploring articles from recognized statistical associations.
